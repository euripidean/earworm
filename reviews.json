        "content": "It's a majestic album, dramatic, propulsive, reeling with remarkable images, more resonant with every listen. Musically, the more muted songs (Sweetheart Come, Gates to the Garden) pick up where 1997's The Boatman's Call left off, but while that album's lyrics prickled with rejection and the raw hurt of relationships in splinters, this one radiates romance - perplexed and tentative to be sure, but more trusting of love and its possibilities.

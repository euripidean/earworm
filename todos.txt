 - Add Profile page (with edit profile section)
 - Favourite artist option (check the Book Auth lab)

// How to make field read only when going from Artist > Add Album Try This: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9599551/wtforms-support-for-input-readonly-attribute
// Add 'Follow Artist' button (and follower count?)

  - Profile page: only logged in user can edit.
 - Edit pages for reviews: only user who created it can edit.
   CHECK - Better validation on reviews if possible (MAYBE DONE?)
   - Can we use pre-existing page info to pre-populate form for creating review etc? Yes.

 Styling General
 DONE - Footer
 // - Better styling of users if there's time
 DONE - Set rating as radio and style into stars, if possible. https://codepen.io/nnoy01/pen/VwPdeNo
 // - User styling just needs to be image w username underneath IF the user profile is public. Maybe add this to review page as well? YARP.

 Issues
 When you go to edit a review the rating stars revert to zero because it's not possible to push them back through to the form. UNLESS: idea to solve:
 For the form if rating has a value (or could just pass through an 'edit' variable on render?) if rating = 1, show with checked marker, if 2, etc. Might be worth a try.
 ^ HAHAHAHAHA! This worked!

 When something is a query field, I need to make it so the right value is showing. Managed this on artist > album.
 Need to make it so that on artist > album it's an uneditable field
 On edit review it should be and editable field ??? if someone selected the wrong artist for the album first time round or something.

 DON'T FORGET TO WRITE SOME TESTS.
